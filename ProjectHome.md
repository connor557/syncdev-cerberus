# Welcome to Cerberus Themes Set #
## for Synchronet Bulletin Board System ##


### Summary ###

Synchronet Bulletin Board System is a Multi-Protocol BBS Server created by Rob Swindell: http://www.synchro.net

Synchronet has several different versions for a variety of Operating System Platforms: http://www.synchro.net/docs/platforms.html

Cerberus Themes Set is an addon for Synchweb (sometimes also coined as "Syncweb" which is a shorthand term for the "Synchronet Web Interface") which consists of a variety of brand new interface themes and [new features](NewFeatures.md).

Though most of the new features are primarily HTML Tweaks, implementation of improvements and elimination of common annoyances -- Cerberus also take advantage of third party online Services (Such as [BBSmates](http://www.bbsmates.com), [FREEdns](http://freedns.afraid.org), [BBSfinder](http://bbsfinder.com), Google Gadgets and many more) as well as third party applications and APIs (such as JavaTelnet, [PJIRC](http://www.pjirc.com), etc).

### Purpose ###

Within the BBS Scene there seems to be an abundance of talent and creativity while a deficit on how much of that skill is actually being put to use. If we had to guess, 9 out of every 10 Synchronet BBSes are left at defaults and unmodded. An army of "Identical Twins" all with different names and internet addresses.

Though we understand that Sysops "have lives" and can not dedicate an unreasonable amount of time to what is supposed to be an enjoyable hobby -- the primary reason that we've discovered for the "stock syndrome epidemic" has been that a great many of those Sysops underestimate their own skills. They seem to feel that their learning curve versus available time does not efficiently add up.

#### Common Reasons Sysops Give For Running Stock Boards ####

- HTML is too hard

- I'm not a programmer

- I don't have time to learn HTML

- I'm not good with graphics design

- I'm not good with creating ANSi Artwork

#### Our Rebuttals To Those Listed Reasons ####

- No, it's not. Time Warrior, the head of this project, knows HTML Fluently, has limited time to work on these sorts of projects and couldn't "program" his way out of a paper bag if his life depended on it. HTML is EASY and it doesn't require knowing much of it to be useful.

- Neither are a lot of us. HTML is glorified Word Processing, NOT programming. HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. A markup, or to use synonym terminology -- a "glorified text based configuration". If you can configure a BBS, you can learn HTML. Complete morons can customize their Myspace Profiles by learning HTML. We think Sysops are much more intelligent than most of those who use Myspace.

- As Einstein once said: "Time is relative". No one ever claimed it was required that you learn HTML within the next 10 minutes. Sites such as http://www.w3schools.com make it easy for anyone to learn quickly, with explanations in plain English.


- You only know how to use a Graphical Editor such as GIMP: http://www.gimp.org (which is free and open source, runs on Windows, Linux and other OSes). Cerberus Themes Set also provides sub directories packed with Public Domain (CCL / GNU / GPL) graphics for you to play with.

- Though the Cerberus Themes Set does not venture into the realms of Telnet Shells (yet, anyways!) there are plenty of "nice looking" Public Domain ANSi out there and to modify what already exists to fit your BBS isn't hard and doesn't require you to be an Artist. If you download Artpacks from places such as http://artpacks.scene.org or http://artscene.textfiles.com or http://sixteencolors.net -- you might notice that in many of these packs, there are "free for all to use" sections in there -- with login screens, menu screens and other graphics designed for the purpose of any Sysop who wants to use them to be able to do so. True, most of these things were made in the 1990's, but so what? Most of them are also not being used on any BBS right now.

### Examples of Modded Systems ###
